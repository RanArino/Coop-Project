# Project Title: Co-op Project - Pricing Calculator App

This project is a Python-based web application that I developed at Drone Cleaning Company that I joined as a Co-op Innternship placement. 

**Key Features:**

1. Secure User Authentication: Restricts access to authorized users via a robust login system using Firebase and GCP Identity
Platform.
2. Data Entry and Real-time Calculation: Enables efficient data input with intuitive forms and provides instant feedback through real-time calculation updates, enhancing user experience and productivity.
3. Integrated Location Services: Utilizes Google Maps API for seamless address geocoding, location search, and interactive map visualization, enhancing user experience with location-based data.
4. Automated Data Verification: Implements robust data validation to ensure accuracy and consistency, generates Google Sheets based on user demand, supports seamless verified data upload to Cloud SQL for persistent storage.
5. Interactive Data Exploration & Dashboards: Provides intuitive dashboards on the homepage and a dedicated dashboard page, enabling users to select attributes, and input queries for data retrieval and analysis, monitor cleaning project completion, facilitate quick review for each cleaning project.
6. Seamless Database Update: Allows users to efficiently update database records with a user-friendly interface and built-in data validation, ensuring data accuracy and integrity while providing real-time feedback on update status.
7. Feedback System with Notion: Streamlines user feedback collection by integrating with Notion API, allowing users to submit feedback and optional screenshots directly to a designated Notion page, facilitating efficient issue tracking and web app improvement.
